## General Information
The dataset that you will be wrangling (and analyzing and visualizing) is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.10.5

## Setup
Before start off you need to download "twitter-archive-enhanced.csv" data which contains some data about dog breeds, "image-predictions.tsv" which is a table full of image predictions (the top three only) alongside each tweet ID, image URL, and the image number and additional data from Twitter API that is, we have the WeRateDogs Twitter archive and specifically the tweet IDs within it, can gather this data for all 5000+. And then we are going to query Twitter's API to gather this valuable data.

## Usage
Anyone who wants to gather data especially from Twitter API can use this project as a template and answer the questions of the project.
